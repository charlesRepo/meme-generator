This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages. Follow these steps to set it up:

### 1. Push your code to GitHub

Make sure your project is pushed to a GitHub repository.

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. The workflow will automatically deploy your site when you push to the `main` branch

### 3. Access your deployed site

Once the GitHub Actions workflow completes successfully, your site will be available at:
`https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

### 4. Manual deployment (optional)

If you want to build and test the static export locally:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a static export in the `out` directory that you can serve locally or deploy manually.
